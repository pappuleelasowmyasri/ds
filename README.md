# Iris Flower Classification

This project develops a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using various techniques to ensure high accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset contains **sepal and petal length/width** measurements for different Iris species.
